This is a school project I have completed with a partner, this project is a homemade tachometer and you could use a tachometer to measure rpms of any type of rotating object.


More specifically, we intended to make this tachometer to measure the rpms of an exercise bike and measure the rpms.

# List of tools and items needed for this project

- Screwdriver
- Arduino
- L2C backpack( a small display)
- IR sensor ( to read the rpms)
- Small piece of tape
- A exercise bike( or anything that has a rotating component to it) 
- Jumpers( small wires)

  You could edit and tweak things to make it more complicated and sophisticated if you'd like
